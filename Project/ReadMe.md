TCP stands for Transmission Control Protocol and UDP stands for User Datagram Protocol. Both TCP and UDP protocols belong to the Transport layer of the TCP/IP reference model. The key difference between the TCP and UDP is that TCP is a connection – oriented protocol, and UDP is a connectionless protocol.
The aim of this project is to develop a model that performs TCP – like protocol within the UDP data.
The approach that has been adopted for developing the project was imitating a TCP behavior over UDP based sockets. During the implementation of the project the cost of overhead is minimal, as a result lightweight packets can be transmitted in quick sessions. The imitation of TCP - like protocol happens in UDP data part of the UDP packet.
This repository also consists of a powerpoint presentation and a PDF file where the flow diagram, description of the project etc can be seen.
